At Oak Tree Home Buyers we buy houses from people who need to sell quickly.
Traditional real estate sales expect completely updated houses and usually take 6 months or more to sell.
We are not real estate agents.

Our goal is to create a win-win solution.
We will make you a cash offer, often in as little as 48 hours.
We ensure a fast, hassle-free, stress-free sale!
Everything about the process is explained in a straight forward manner.
We never use complicated legalese.
You will know exactly the amount of money that you will receive.

There are no fees or commissions.
You will not need to spend money on fixing or updating your house.
Take what you want when you move, and we'll take care of cleanup and repairs.
We do it all, and you get cash for your house quickly.

We offer creative solutions.
Calls are confidential, and you are under no obligation.
